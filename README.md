# DESKTOP TIP CALCULATOR


## 📚 About

This app has as its main function a common action that people do when they meet friends and family at a restaurant or a bar: split the Bill for how many individuals are in the party, highlighting the tip amount per person. 
All the stylizations are self-made, only using the technology listed below.

## 🚫 System validations

Predicting some user’s actions, the system was built to not show or collapse values when negative numbers or divisions/multiplications by zero are set as an input. In the same way, to prevent the CSS structure, a little joke was implemented when the user types a large number as a “Bill” input.
